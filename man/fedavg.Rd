\title{Federated Averaging (FedAvg)}
\usage{
fedavg(params, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A list of numeric vectors of equal length. Each vector represents the model
parameters from a single client.}

\item{weights}{A numeric vector of non-negative weights (e.g., number of
samples \code{n_k}) corresponding to each client in \code{params}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector representing the aggregated model parameters (\verb{w_\{t+1\}}).
}
\description{
Aggregates client model parameters using the Federated Averaging algorithm
as described by McMahan et al. (2017). The aggregation is a weighted
average of the client parameters, where the weights are typically the
number of samples on each client.

The formula is: \eqn{w_{t+1} = \sum_k (n_k / \sum_j n_j)\, w^{(k)}_{t+1}}
}
\examples{
# Example with two clients
client1_params <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
client2_params <- c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)
client_params <- list(client1_params, client2_params)

# Weights are the number of data samples on each client
client_samples <- c(100, 200)

aggregated_params <- fedavg(client_params, client_samples)
print(aggregated_params)
# Expected: (100 * c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3) + 200 * c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)) / 300
